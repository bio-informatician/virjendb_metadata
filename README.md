# VirJenDB Metadata

This repository serves as the ground truth for the metadata schema of the VirJenDB

**Find our current metadata schema and expansions on the branch `v0.3`** \
They are available for download in `.json`, `.tsv`, `.csv` and `.xml` format in the corresponding folders.

The complete metadata catalogue can be explored in the `metadata.xlsx` on `main` branch or via our upcoming [_Metadata Explorer_](https://virjendb.org/MetadataTemplates). It also allows you to build and download custom lists of metadata fields.

## Metadata.xlsx

This is the working file of the repository. All information for all the metadata fields will be collected in there.

### **Attenion!**

Only open tile file via `Excel`! There are build in formulas, to keep them intact please refrain from using Google Sheets or Libre Office Calc. For none windows users, there is an online version of [Excel](https://excel.cloud.microsoft/).

For working within the file please stick to the following guidelines:

- `Row 1` - describes the object the information of the columns is derived from or that it adresses, e.g. `ENA`, `VJDBv0.3`
- `Row 2` - describes the purpose or meaning of the column information, e.g. `description`, `field id`
- `Row 3` - **DONT CHANGE THIS ROW** - Helper to construct the naming of a columns from `Row 1` and `Row 2`. When a new columns is created drag the formula from the previous columns to populate the field.
- `Row 4` - **DONT CHANGE THIS ROW** - Contains the real name of the column. This field is created by formulas using `Row 3`. When a new columns is created drag the formula from the previous columns to populate the field.
- `vjdbv0.3_tags` - **DONT CHANGE THIS COLUMN** - This column constructs the tags for a metadata field from other columns (H - U). For columns H - P it inserts the naming of `Row 1` if the cell of the columns is filled, for the other columns is inserts the value of the field if there is one in the column. For new rows the formula is to be extended. Should a new tag be introduced by a new column the formula needs to be adjusted.

## Metadata Update Process

- create a new branch
- edit the `metadata.xlsx` file
- commit your changes to your branch
- create a merge request with the main branch

Once the merge was approved github actions runs the `convert_xlsx_to_tsv.py` script and builds a trackable tsv version of the schema. Once finished github actions runs `create_output_files.py` and pushes the newly build file formats to the corresponding branch.

### convert_xlsx_to_tsv.py

This script converts the xlsx file into tsv files that can be tracked. It is run everytime a push to main happens that changes `metadata.xlsx`. The number of output files is determined by

```python
WANTED_FILES = [
    {"sheet_name": "VJDBCore", "cols": ["vjdbv0.3_field_id", "vjdbv0.3_name", "vjdbv0.3_description", "vjdbv0.3_fields_type", "vjdbv0.3_privacy"], "filename": "VJDBCore"},
    {"sheet_name": "VJDBCore", "cols": ["vjdbv0.3_field_id", "vjdbv0.3_name", "vjdbv0.3_tags"], "filename": "Tags"},
    {"sheet_name": "VJDBCore", "cols": ["vjdbv0.3_field_id", "vjdbv0.3_name", "vjdbv0.3_description", "vjdbv0.3_tags", "vjdbv0.3_privacy"], "filename": "Frontend"},
    {"sheet_name": "VJDBCore", "cols": ["vjdbv0.3_field_id", "vjdbv0.3_name", "vjdbv0.3_description", "vjdbv0.3_tags", "vjdbv0.3_privacy", "ena_submission_fieldtype", "vjdb_submission_requiredness", "ena_submission_validation"], "filename": "Submission"},
    {"sheet_name": "VJDBCore", "cols": ["vjdbv0.3_field_id", "vjdbv0.3_fields_type", "ena_submission_validation", "vjdbv0.3_input_source", "ncbi_virus_n_nucleotide_field_id", "bv-brc_b_field_name", "vjdbv0.3_privacy", "vjdbv0.3_tags", "vjdbv0.3_description", "vjdbv0.3_field_index"], "filename": "DB_Scheme"},
    ]
```

- `sheet_name` - describes the name of the excel sheet that should be converted
- `cols` - describes a list of the columns name the should be included in the newly generated tsv file.
- `filename` - describes the name of the output file

To create a new file add an dictionary containing the above information to the array of `WANTED_FILES`. An tsv files will be created for every element in the array. The output tsv files will be used by `create_output_files.py` to generated json, xml and csv files of it.\
Additionally one file with all columns will be created called `VJDB_catalogue`.

- Note: The first three rows of the excel will be skipped `usecols=lambda x: x in wanted_file["cols"], skiprows=3)`

### On VirJenDB Release Change

Update the name of the new branch in the `.github/workflow/file_publication.yaml`

```yaml
# Step 6: Create a new branch and remove all existing files
- name: Commit converted files
  env:
    OUTPUT_BRANCH: "v0.3" # Define your branch name
```

And the documentation ;)
